title: Creating a Jekyll Now blog
---

My previous website was built with WordPress, but I was never really happy with it.  I wanted my site to be aesthetically pleasing and my posts to adhere to technical writing standards, but trying to get WordPress to do what I wanted was like navigating a maze.  I tried to decipher WordPress's interface with the help of its documentation, but I always came away feeling that these tools were meant for someone with much more experience than I had.  Beyond a few hacks like inlining my CSS, I didn't make much progress and eventually gave up on having a pretty website.

Then I took a class on reactive web design.  The class's final project had me create a webpage using HTML, CSS, and a touch of jQuery.  Compared to my personal website, this page was a thing of absolute beauty.  Surely I could use my new skills to improve it.

Unfortunately, I still found WordPress unyielding.  I struggled for awhile, but eventually decided that the path of least resistance was to rebuild my personal website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
