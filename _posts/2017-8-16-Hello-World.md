title: Creating a Jekyll Now blog
---

<p>
    My previous website was built with WordPress, but I was never really happy with it.  I wanted my site to be aesthetically pleasing and my posts to adhere to technical writing standards, but trying to get WordPress to do what I wanted was like navigating a maze.  I tried to decipher WordPress's interface with the help of its documentation, but I always came away feeling that these tools were meant for someone with much more experience than I had.  Beyond a few hacks like inlining my CSS, I didn't make much progress and eventually gave up on having a pretty website.

    Then I took a class on reactive web design.  The class's final project had me create a webpage using HTML, CSS, and a touch of jQuery.  Compared to my personal website, this page was a thing of absolute beauty.  Surely I could use my new skills to improve it.

    Unfortunately, I still found WordPress unyielding.  I struggled for awhile, but eventually decided that the path of least resistance was to rebuild my personal website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

    It turned out to be a great decision.  Not only did I end up with an aesthetic I'm much happier with, but it gave me the opportunity to really push the limits of what I had previously learned by applying them to a project that was important to me.

    However, there were a few aspects of my previous site that I didn't have the skills to recreate.  The most important item on that list was a blog.  I did a bit of research and learned that making a blog from scratch would be a larger and more complex project than I wanted to dive into.  So I started looking for API's, and eventually I found Jekyll Now.
