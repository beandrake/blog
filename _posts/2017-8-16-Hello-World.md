title: Recreating my Site from Scratch
---

<p>
    My previous website was built with WordPress, but I was never really happy with it.  I wanted my site to be aesthetically pleasing and my posts to adhere to technical writing standards, but trying to get WordPress to do what I wanted was like navigating a maze.  I tried to decipher WordPress's interface with the help of its documentation, but I always came away feeling that these tools were meant for someone with much more experience than I had.  Beyond a few hacks like inlining my CSS, I didn't make much progress and eventually gave up on having a pretty website.

    Then I took a class on reactive web design.  For the class's final project, I implemented a webpage for a fake business using HTML, CSS, and a touch of jQuery.  Compared to my personal website, this page was a thing of absolute beauty.  I was excited about the possibility to use these newfound skills to improve my WordPress site.

    Unfortunately, I still found WordPress unyielding.  In a way it was even more difficult than before, because I had all of these things that I knew how to do, but I couldn't understand WordPress's interface enough to figure out where to do them.  After struggling for awhile, I eventually decided that the path of least resistance was to rebuild my personal website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

    It turned out to be a great decision.  Not only did I end up with an aesthetic I'm much happier with, but it gave me the opportunity to really push the limits of what I had previously learned by applying them to a project that was important to me.

    I'll probably dig into the details of this transition in future posts, but that's enough for now.
