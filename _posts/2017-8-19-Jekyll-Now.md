title: Making a Jekyll Now Blog
---

<p>
    I previously wrote about abandoning my WordPress website in favor of creating my own website from scratch.

    However, there were a few aspects of my previous site that I didn't have the skills to recreate.  The most important item on that list was a blog.  I did a bit of research and learned that making a blog from scratch would be a larger and more complex project than I wanted to dive into.  So I started looking for API's, and eventually I found Jekyll Now.
